Pathogenic Escherichia coli genome analysis

In Germany in 2011, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli strain caused severe disease outbreak. In this study, the source and reason of its virulence were analyzed using genome sequences of a sample of the pathogenic strain. The most similar strain was E. coli 55989, but the bacteria had resistance to 5 more antibiotics. It also contained shiga toxin similar with Shigella dysenteriae toxin.
