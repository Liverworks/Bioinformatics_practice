Life on the Edge: The Study of Tardigrades’ Survival Mechanisms

It is now generally recognised that tardigrades are capable of withstanding some of the most severe environmental conditions. Among other things, one can assume that they remain highly resistant to shortwave UV radiation. To study the fact, the mechanism of tardigrades’ DNA-protecting were explored using the genome of Ramazzottius varieornatus, one of the most stress-tolerant species (the YOKOZUNA-1 strain). Considering that DNA is a major target of radiation damage, proteins associated with DNA protection and/or reparation were studied. It was found that the probable ‘damage suppressor protein’ is the unique tardigrade protein DSUP, which protects chromatin from reactive particles of oxygen and hydrogen appearing under radiation influence. The further research of tardigrades may provide keys to protection and long-life of human cells.
