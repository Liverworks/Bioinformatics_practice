Rapid and mass purchase of antibiotic resistance by pathogen bacteria is one of the greatest problems nowadays. Microorganisms have a number of adaptations for survival in the presence of antibiotics. This study predicts which of single nucleotide replacements in E. coli strain K-12 substrain MG1655 can be responsible for its  ampicillin resistance. Five mismatches were found. Of these replacements in peptidoglycan transpeptidase and multidrug efflux pump AcrB are more likely to be associated with ampicillin resistance.
